# OpenYAMM

OpenYAMM is Open Yet Another Might and Magic: a modern C++ reimplementation of
Might and Magic VI, VII, and VIII, inspired by MMMerge and built on an engine
that started from Might and Magic VIII.

It uses the original game data with HD artwork, a new HUD and menus, modern
rendering, and UX improvements.

## Status

OpenYAMM is playable across Might and Magic VI, VII, and VIII, including
continent travel between the games. Windows, Linux, and Android builds are
supported.

The games share combat, spells, dialogue, quests, inventory, party state, and
save/load systems. Development is active, with ongoing work on gameplay
compatibility, polish, tooling, and the editor.

## Features

- HD textures, items, equipment, portraits, and interface backgrounds
- HD MM6 monsters
- New Obsidian HUD, menus, inventory, dialogue, and journal screens
- Indoor and outdoor water with reflections, lightmaps, and shadows
- Modeled MM6 ships and HD decorations
- Enemy health bars, floating damage, and party recovery indicators
- Android touch controls and context actions

## Assets

Development assets are loaded from:

```text
assets_dev/
```

The default development layout is:

```text
assets_dev/
  engine/             shared tables, scripts and presentation
  worlds/mm6/         world-local maps and presentation
  worlds/mm7/
  worlds/mm8/
  worlds/mmmerge/     Merge-specific maps
```

Runtime packages can be distributed as ZIP archives under:

```text
assets/
```

The engine keeps practical original asset formats such as TXT gameplay tables, BMP-style
art assets, WAV sound effects, MP3/FLAC music, and OGV video. Legacy archive and video
container formats are replaced for runtime use.

Runtime assets and the prebuilt Android sprite profile are stored directly
in Git, so a normal clone can build and launch against `assets_dev` and CI can package
Android without texture encoding or Git LFS. The lossless sprite inputs, creature
master bank, original extractions and editor assets are optional local authoring
data. See [asset storage and optional review tools](tools/ASSET_STORAGE.md).
The MM9 world payload is currently local and is excluded from the portable checkout.

## Building

The engine uses C++20, SDL3, bgfx, PhysicsFS, FFmpeg, and Lua. Gameplay tables
use tab-separated text, and scene and UI layouts use YAML.

Requirements:

- CMake 3.22 or newer
- C++20 compiler
- Git and Python 3.11 or newer
- standard native build tools for your platform

CMake fetches and builds the project dependencies, including Lua 5.4. A separate
system Lua development package is not required.

Configure and build:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --target openyamm -j25
```

Run:

```sh
./build/game/openyamm
```

Build tests:

```sh
cmake --build build --target openyamm_unit_tests -j25
./build/tests/openyamm_unit_tests
```

Build the editor:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DOPENYAMM_BUILD_EDITOR=ON
cmake --build build --target openyamm-editor -j25
```

Run the editor:

```sh
./build/editor/openyamm-editor
```

## Visual Checks

For repeatable visual checks, see [Desktop runs and native screenshot tours](tools/RUN_GAME.md).
The game can save PNGs directly through bgfx, including the HUD, on Wayland or X11. Use the debug
console command `screenshot [name]`, launch-time capture settings, or a YAML tour to capture several
camera poses in one run. Ready-to-run MM6/MM7/MM8 water viewpoints are in
[`tools/screenshot_tours/`](tools/screenshot_tours/).

## Nightly Builds

The [Package builds](https://github.com/pjasicek/openyamm/actions/workflows/nightly.yml) GitHub Actions workflow
builds unsigned Windows x64, x86_64 Flatpak, and signed Android arm64 packages every day at 03:27 UTC. After all
packages pass structural and checksum checks, the workflow uploads complete packages to Nextcloud and updates the
[nightly prerelease](https://github.com/pjasicek/openyamm/releases/tag/nightly) with download links and checksums.
Public release links are published once a public Nextcloud folder share is configured.
See [Nextcloud publishing setup](packaging/NEXTCLOUD.md) for the repository secrets and public folder share.
The same workflow can be run manually,
with publishing optionally disabled so the packages remain short-lived workflow artifacts.

Every push to `main` also gets its own package-build run for Windows x64, x86_64 Flatpak, and Android arm64. Open the
commit's `Package builds` run on the Actions page to download its SHA-named artifacts. Commit artifacts are retained for
one day; scheduled builds continue to update the rolling nightly prerelease.

Extract the Windows zip and run `openyamm.exe`. Install or update the Flatpak bundle with:

```sh
flatpak install --user --reinstall OpenYAMM-nightly-x86_64.flatpak
```

On an arm64 Android 6.0 or newer device, download `OpenYAMM-nightly-android-arm64.apk` and open it to install or update
the nightly. Android may ask you to allow installs from the browser or file manager used to open the APK.

Nightly packages are development snapshots and may be unstable. Back up existing saves before using them. Publishing
packaged game assets remains subject to the asset distribution rights noted in the Windows distribution documentation.

## Tagged Releases

Pushing a canonical `X.Y` tag, such as `1.0`, runs the same validated package builds. With public Nextcloud
publishing configured, it creates a normal GitHub release for that tag. The release links to versioned
Windows, Flatpak, and signed Android packages on Nextcloud and contains their SHA256 files.
The Android version name matches the tag; its monotonically increasing version code is calculated as
`major * 10000 + minor * 100` (`1.0` becomes `10000`).

Create a release only after the workflow changes are present on the commit being tagged:

```sh
git tag -a 1.0 -m "OpenYAMM 1.0"
git push origin 1.0
```

The workflow rejects non-canonical versions, does not mark tagged releases as prereleases, and does not overwrite an
existing release with the same tag.
