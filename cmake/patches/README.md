## Direct3D 11 compressed texture updates

`bgfx-d3d11-compressed-updates.patch` fixes uploads of compressed mip levels with dimensions that are not
multiples of four. Row pitches round up to complete blocks, slice pitches count block rows, and full-mip
updates pass a null destination box so Direct3D accepts the unaligned virtual edges. Partial updates retain
their destination box and explicit source pitches are preserved.

The Windows 1.0 package includes townsfolk mips sized 246×280 and 123×140. The upstream upload uses
976/480-byte BC7 rows instead of 992/496 bytes, and submits nonaligned destination boxes. Rejected uploads
leave distant sprites invisible; trilinear blending between valid and missing levels makes them translucent.
This fixes the Direct3D backend without changing sprite shaders, source assets or the atlas format.

Run `python3 tests/test_bgfx_d3d11_texture_updates.py` after configuring the desktop build. The check compiles
the actual patched upload function against a recording Direct3D context, covering uneven/tiny mips, BC4/BC5/BC7,
partial and pitched updates, array/cube indexing, uncompressed textures, and compressed 3D slice pitches.
It does not replace a visual check on a Windows GPU.

## GLES compressed texture updates

`bgfx-gles-unpack-row-length.patch` recognizes `GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH` as core functionality in GLES 3.
Without this check, GLES 3 drivers that omit the redundant `EXT_unpack_subimage` extension use the pixel-row
copy path even for block-compressed textures. Uneven mip dimensions make that temporary buffer smaller than
the compressed payload, causing an out-of-bounds read during upload. GLES 3 now uploads the original block
buffer directly. Desktop GL retains its existing path.

The Android release regression check loads New Sorpigal's cooked atlases, whose mip dimensions include
254×278 and 127×139, with the emulator's GL pipe checksum enabled:

```sh
python3 android/test_release_apk.py android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk \
  --serial emulator-5554 --world mm6 --map oute3.odm --output /tmp/openyamm-gles-upload-test
```

For local visual checks, start the emulator with `-gpu host` and retain its GL pipe checksum checks.

## Desktop uniform cache

`bgfx-gl-uniform-cache.patch` targets the bgfx revision pinned in `cmake/Dependencies.cmake`:
`a73c12db8f502022d292cc6fb8872482997b0664`.

The patch connects desktop GL uniform upload functions to `engine/GlUniformCache.h`. It keeps values per GL program
and array-element location, skips identical uploads, removes destroyed programs, and clears values with the backend's
cache invalidation/shutdown. Matrix transpose state is part of the comparison. Program switches retain each program's
values; GL stores those values in the program object. This cache belongs to the renderer instance and render thread.

The desktop path uses byte comparisons and copies, avoiding alignment/aliasing assumptions when reading uniform data.
Android/GLES and Emscripten retain the upstream implementation. Other rendering backends are unaffected.

`OPENYAMM_GL_UNIFORM_CACHE` defaults to `ON`. Configure with `-DOPENYAMM_GL_UNIFORM_CACHE=OFF` to build the original
desktop upload path for comparisons. Rebuild `openyamm` after changing it.

`cmake/BgfxGlUniformCache.cmake` applies the patch during dependency configuration, including already-populated build
trees. It recognizes an already-applied patch and fails if neither the forward nor reverse patch matches. When updating
the bgfx pin or patch, rebase the patch deliberately and use a fresh dependency checkout, or reverse the previous patch
first. Do not manually edit generated dependency sources as the permanent fix.

Validation uses `GlUniformCacheTests.cpp` for value/lifetime/array behavior and real-GPU New Sorpigal captures for
integration. See `docs/PERF_NEW_SORPIGAL_SUBMISSIONS.md` for measurements and limitations. GL upload counts alone do
not establish a frame-rate improvement.
